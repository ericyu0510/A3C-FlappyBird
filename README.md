# A3C-FlappyBird
An Tensorflow 2 implementation of Flappy Bird using A3C with PLE and pygame backend.

## Training steps
1. Set the available GPU, seed you want to use, hyperparameters(gamma, update_interval, actor_lr, critic_lr), save_model_episode, Actor's entropy_beta, max_episode in A3C.py
2. Modify the path yout want to save the model. (line 333 in A3C.py)
3. In command line, type ```python A3C.py``` and it will start training.
